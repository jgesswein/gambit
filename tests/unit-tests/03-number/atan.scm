If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559), 

If y is ±0 and x is negative or -0, ±π is returned
If y is ±0 and x is positive or +0, ±0 is returned
If y is ±∞ and x is finite, ±π/2 is returned
If y is ±∞ and x is -∞, ±3π/4 is returned
If y is ±∞ and x is +∞, ±π/4 is returned
If x is ±0 and y is negative, -π/2 is returned
If x is ±0 and y is positive, +π/2 is returned
If x is -∞ and y is finite and positive, +π is returned
If x is -∞ and y is finite and negative, -π is returned
If x is +∞ and y is finite and positive, +0 is returned
If x is +∞ and y is finite and negative, -0 is returned
If either x is NaN or y is NaN, NaN is returned
