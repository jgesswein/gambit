You have successfully installed @NAME@ v@VERSION@ (@VARIANT@ variant).

<p>
If you want to use the Gambit Scheme compiler, <code>gsc</code>, to
compile Scheme files you will need the <code>gcc</code> C compiler.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to get <code>gcc</code> is to install
Apple's Xcode Developer Tools that come with a <code>gcc</code> C compiler
based on LLVM.  It is easy to install but is slow when compiling C code
generated by the Gambit Scheme compiler and it produces slow code.
Xcode can be obtained on the App Store.
</p>

<p>
It is best to install the GNU <code>gcc</code> C compiler.  This can
be done using <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a> or installing
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install">from scratch</a>.  Make sure that
the executable is named <code>gcc</code> and not something like
<code>gcc-7</code> (you may need to add a symbolic link because the
Gambit Scheme compiler and its scripts call <code>gcc</code> and by
default that is the Xcode one).
</p>

<p>
Gambit can be uninstalled by executing the shell command
</p>

<p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo uninstall-gambit v@VERSION@</code>
